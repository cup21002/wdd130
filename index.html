    <h2>Brian Cuppett</h2>
    <p>Hi everybody my names Brian Cuppett and I'm from Los Angeles California. I'm 23 years old seeking a career and degree in software development. I am currently not married but at the moment.<p> </p>Hobbies that I enjoy was playing video games but I have recently given that up so now I do photography/videography (weddings and wildlife), workout, and considering to learn graphic design. I used to worked armed and concealed carry security for clients but, I always had a passion for technology and wish to further pursue this career path.<p> </p> After coming from a community college BYU-Idaho is without a doubt a night and day difference of a school and it being LDS makes it better for me personally. The advantages from learning software development tends to be working from home as it is an amazing opportunity to have a better quality of life. I have been a member of the church since birth and my favorite scripture is 2 Timothy 1:7 For God gave us a spirit not of fear but of power and love and self-control. This verse speaks to me by reminding me the Lord has given us spirit to overpower evil and have self discipline through him.   </p>
